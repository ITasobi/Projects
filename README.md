Just silly programs I am creating whyle learning
for Test_fyle:

For now it is working but I am still trying to:
  restrict the input to int characters
  reset the printed data for each loop
  rearrange the numbers that had been already entered into increasing order (for this I think I have to rewrite the whole thing, since it will destroy the whole conditioning afterwards. or maybe create a variable with another type of data - since the set can't be modified - and use that for printing)
